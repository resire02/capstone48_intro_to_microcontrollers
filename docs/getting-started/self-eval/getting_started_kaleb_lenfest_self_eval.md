**What went well during the learning process?**  
The basic steps installing the arduino IDE were very easy, as simple as going to their website and in this case installing the newest version. 

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
Not really, the biggest snag was probably having the needed board package not show up until we gave it the path to the additional board manager in preferences. 

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
Nothing really, everything felt very smooth and easy to set up

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
N/A

**Notes:**

- Installed packages are located in the AppData folder, which is hidden by default on windows  
- Show Verbose settings can assist in debugging in future labs
