**Sprint Topic:**		Running the Blink Sketch  
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
The setup of the program was easy since it was an example, most of the work was not with the coding but with learning the board itself

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
- Understanding where to find certain files like the pins_arduino.h for our specific board type was difficult at first.  
- Coorelating pin name to where it was on the board
- Thought not required, soldering the pins into place on the board was difficult from the perspective of someone having never done it, though might not be applicable to this manual

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
Deploying the program to the board in the event that there is more than one USB option can get confusing, options and reasons for how deployment was handled seemed vague

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
I did not really run into any intense issues, 

**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**

- Where to find the correct pins_arduino.h file
- Specific settings for deployment to the board, and ideally why
- How to determine correct USB
