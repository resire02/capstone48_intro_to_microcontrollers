**Sprint Topic:**		Running the Blink Sketch  
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
It was relatively easy to load, modify, and run the blink script from the examples.

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
It was hard to understand how the defined constant mapped to the LED on the board.

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
I was not able to load the blink program directly onto the Curiosity nano.

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
I fixed not being able to load the blink program by changing the cable I was using.

**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**

* The USB-to-MicroUSB cable may hinder the port connection, this can be absolved by using a different cable.   
* If the LED near the USB cable blinks, it means that the upload to the onboard programmer was successful.   
* COM-7 is also an acceptable port.   
* Standard serial over bluetooth does not work for upload.
