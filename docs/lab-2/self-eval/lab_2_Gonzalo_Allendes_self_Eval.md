**Research**

In this lab I found out that Wiring and Arduino were actually invented in a small institute named IDII (Interaction Design Institute Ivrea) in Italy in 2004.
The concept of developing is to write code, observe the resulting behavior of the attached sensors, modify something in the code, and iterate.
As mentioned in [this Wikipedia article]() 'the concept is called sketching with hardware; explore ideas quickly, select the more interesting ones, refine and produce prototypes in an iterative process.'
The peripheral I will be exploring is the tinyNeoPixel ring. It is a ring with LED lights that alternate to produce a looping LED sequence of alternating colors.
The code for it is in the function void ring_chase(void)

**What went well during the learning process?**  
I effectively understood how the function produces the result I am researching.

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
Yes, the code for the function had some parts that I had to research, such as the number 211UL with a suffix UL that means unsigned long.

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
I encountered no problems!

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
No issues were found while working with Arduino.

**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**
It will be important to explain the functions that are being imported from the Adafruit and TinyNeoPixel libraries.
