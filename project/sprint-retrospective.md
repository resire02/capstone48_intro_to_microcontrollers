| Meeting Date     | Previous Sprint<br/>Number | Previous Sprint<br/>Goals                             | Previous Sprint Dates       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| October 2, 2024  | 1                          | Quick Start Installation Instructions                 | October 2nd - October 9th   | While requirements were achieved nearing the end of the sprint, the goal of the sprint was met with input from most team members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
| October 23, 2024 | 2                          | Lab 1 Manual (Blink an LED!)                          | October 9th - October 22nd  | The sprint goal was achieved and all tasks were completed. However, the amount of workload for the sprint was not sufficient to cover the entire sprint due to the simple nature of the tasks. The sprint durations are synchronized with the sponsor's fixed bi-monthly meeting schedule, which led to a period of inactivity at the end of this sprint. |
| November 5, 2024 | 3                          | Lab 2 Manual (Intro to Curiosity Nano Explorer Board) | October 23rd - November 5th | The current sprint went well. The sprint goals were achieved and although we had to cover some open ended requirements, we generally distributed the workload in equivalent portions and met the sponsor's initial expectations. We are waiting for his feedback while he reviews our work.                                                               |
