| October 2, 2024     | 1                          | Quick Start Installation Instructions                                                                             | October 2nd - October 9th                        | While requirements were achieved nearing the end of the sprint, the goal of the sprint was met with input from most team members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
| October 23, 2024    | 2                          | Lab 1 Manual (Blink an LED!)                                                                                      | October 9th - October 22nd                       | The sprint goal was achieved and all tasks were completed. However, the amount of workload for the sprint was not sufficient to cover the entire sprint due to the simple nature of the tasks. The sprint durations are synchronized with the sponsor's fixed bi-monthly meeting schedule, which led to a period of inactivity at the end of this sprint. |
| November 6, 2024    | 3                          | Lab 2 Manual (Intro to Curiosity Nano Explorer Board)                                                             | October 23rd - November 5th                      | The current sprint went well. The sprint goals were achieved and although we had to cover some open ended requirements, we generally distributed the workload in equivalent portions and met the sponsor's initial expectations. We are waiting for his feedback while he reviews our work.                                                               |
| November 20, 2024   | 4                          | Lab 3 Manual (Important Embedded System Concepts)                                                                 | November 7th - November 19th                     | The previous sprint's goals were successfully achieved, including the completion of Lab 3. However, we are still waiting for our sponsor to review Lab 2 and now Lab 3 as part of the approval process.                                                                                                                                                   | 
| January 15, 2025    | 5                          | Lab 4 Manual (Interactive Home Automation and Monitoring System)                                                  | November 21st - December 6th                     | The goals of the previous sprint were successfully achieved, including the completion of Lab 4. Following feedback from our sponsor during the meeting on December 12th, we are making minor revisions, which included updates to Neopixel references, adjustments to formatting, and including file references.                                          |
| February 5th, 2025  | 6                          | Lab 0 Manual (Intro to MPLAB X)                                                                                   | January 13th - February 5th                      | The goals of the previous sprint were successfully achieved, including the completion of Lab 0: Getting Started. Students were guided through the process of blinking an LED in MPLAB X using the millis function and received debugging tips.                                                                                                            |
| February 21st, 2025 | 7                          | Lab 1 Manual (UART and Timer)                                                                                     | February 7th - February 19th                     | The goal of the previous sprint was successfully achieved. We completed Lab 1: UART and Timer, allowing students to compare blocking vs. non-blocking executions of a UART string and an LED using delays vs. interrupts.                                                                                                                                 |
| March 6th, 2025     | 8                          | Lab 2 & 3 Manual (Exploring ADC: Single vs. Multi Sampling, and I2C: Read/Write Operations with the IO Expanders) | February 21st - March 5th                        | The goals of the previous sprint were achieved. While the labs require minor adjustments, students can effectively obtain ADC readings using single sampling vs. multiple sampling and utilize I2C with IO Expanders in MPLABX.                                                                                                                           |
| --                  | 9 & 10                     | Lab 4 Manual (Lab 4: Exploring Proximity and Color Sensors)                                                       | March 16th - March 19th & March 21st - April 2nd | The sprint retrospective meeting will include both sprints 9 and 10, considering that Sprint 9 was used to get the 2-week sprint schedule back on track after Spring Break.                                                                                                                                                                               |
