## **Sprint Topic: Arduino Setup**

**What went well during the learning process?**

I had already used the Arduino IDE so I just had to update it. Which was very start forward and I just downloaded the new one. And it had no issues.

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**

I had no issue but having the option of explaining where the DXcore installs was a bit much and was not worth worrying about to consider for our lab materials.

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**

I had no issue as I have already used and had installed Arduino.

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**

I ended up not having any issues with this download, I do know that there are a ton of existing guides and troubleshooting guides out there for arduino.
