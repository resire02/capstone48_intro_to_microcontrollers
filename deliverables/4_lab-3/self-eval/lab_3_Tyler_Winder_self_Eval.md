# Self Learning Evaluation

**Capstone Member:**	Tyler Winder
**Sprint Name:**		Lab 3  
**Link to Taiga Task:**	[https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/99](https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/99)  
**Sprint Topic:**		UART
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
What went well with this lab is that UART is a very common feature in working with microcontrollers, so research is very straight forward.
**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**   
 What is difficult with UART is getting strings from the computor as it can only process a bit at a type, or in other words one character/number.
**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**   
THe only thing that can cause trouble is handling strings in UART.
**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**    
There were not any issues that I faced when dealing with arduino except for the fact that everything needs to be set up correctly.
**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**  
Will have to add a section on how to handle strings in UART.
