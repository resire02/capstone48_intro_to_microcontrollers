# Self Learning Evaluation

**Capstone Member:**	Gonzalo Allendes 
**Sprint Name:**		Lab 1  
**Link to Taiga Task:**	[Task 35](https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/35)  
**Sprint Topic:**		Running the Blink Sketch  
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
The learning process for this lab was very simple. It only consisted of setting up the connection to the board on the Arduino IDE, 
loading a blink sketch, modifying it to match the Curiosity Nano pins, and uploading the sketch to the board to blink an LED.

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
There were no difficult topics during this learning process.

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
The Arduino IDE opens example sketches in read-only mode. I had to copy the content of the file to a new .ino file. 

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
As mentioned in the previous question, I had to copy the content of the file to a new .ino file.

**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**
* There should be a note suggesting the reader to create a new .ino file instead of trying to modify the existing example sketch.
