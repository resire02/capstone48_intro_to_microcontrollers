Sprint Topic: MPLABX IDE Overview and Setup
Document your research in this section
I looked up some simple examples of using UART in MPLABx using MCC.
Using UART uses vary simular code to that of Arduino, just you have to set it up using mcc.
First you need to create your project, launch MCC and enable UART. Then you just configure it to have the right baud rate and the right pin.
# What went well during the learning process?
I found all the basic information easy to access and find.
# Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?
No there was nothing that was difficult. We already covered uart so it was just learning a new IDE.
# What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the MPLABX system?
It was build off of an oldersystem so it can be slow and takes up a lot of space.
# If you encountered any issues while working with MPLABX, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?
