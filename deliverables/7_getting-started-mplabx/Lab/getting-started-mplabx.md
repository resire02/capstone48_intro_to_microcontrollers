## What is MPLAB X IDE?
In this section of the course, we will be learning how to use another embedded programming program, MPLAB X IDE. MPLAB X IDE is a proprietary integrated development environment designed to work with Microchip's line of microcontrollers. It is most commonly used in professional or settings due to its encompassing set of developer features.

## Why use MPLAB X IDE over Arduino IDE?
Leading up to this lab, you have been developing relatively simple programs using Arduino IDE. So why switch over to MPLAB X IDE? The reason ultimately comes down to differences in features:

- MPLAB X IDE's debugger offers deeper manipulation of embedded code including the ability to directly modify chip register values
- MPLAB X IDE's project based development makes it easier to build out multi file programs than Arduino IDE's sketch based development.
- MPLAB X IDE is often regarded as a more professional developer environment as opposed to Arduino IDE



## Installation Walkthrough

1. Go to the MPLAB X download page on microchips website at https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide
2. Download the MPLAB X IDE installer (Windows)
3. Open the installer once it has finished downloading
