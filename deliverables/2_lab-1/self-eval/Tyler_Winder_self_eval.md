**Sprint Topic:**		Running the Blink Sketch  
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
I have experience with the Arduino IDE, so the learning process went well. I spent most of the time refreshing my knowledge of the system.

**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
No. I experienced no difficulties with understanding the process since I have experience with other microcontrollers.

**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
The only issue I had while working with this microcontroller was the fact that you have to install the code on the device a little differently than other microcontrollers. The issue is the fact that this microcontroller has a programmer built into it, which requires a different way of doing things.

**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
Yes, I was able to fix the issue above by simply figuring out the differences between this microcontroller and the other microcontroller that I have used. 
**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**
Yes, the setting up for how to install the code is different and needs to be covered in at least the first 3 to 4 labs.
