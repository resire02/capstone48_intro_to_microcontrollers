# Self Learning Evaluation

### Capstone Member: Kaleb Lenfest

### Sprint Name: MPLABX I2C & ADC

### Link to Taiga Task: [Task 216](https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/216)

### Sprint Topic: Lab 1 UART and Timer research

---

### Document your research in this section

#### Exploration of Sponsor Content for Lab 1:

In this section I explored running the first lab that our sponsor gave us, including printing to the UART and Timer, specifically exploring some of the things that can be done with the callback options on the timer. 
One thing that became very clear was the need to lock resources and be very careful with access times. This was to be expected, but it was definitely a higher demand in terms of paying close attention to the code I was writing.
Overall the setup for both of these felt fairly simple, though using some of the menus like the pin configurer had a bit of a learning curve. 

### What went well during the learning process?

- Setting up the UART and Timer using Melody and the menus associated with each component
- Accessing the methods associated with these functionalities

### Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?

- The pin configurer was a little hard to understand
- Knowing when to use safe-sections or locks with callbacks, more practice than hard difficulty 

### What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the MPLABX system?

- Melody gave me issues with the needed packages to open

### If you encountered any issues while working with MPLABX, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?

- Had to restart a few times, determine what packages I had installed, still sometimes happens, investigating more
