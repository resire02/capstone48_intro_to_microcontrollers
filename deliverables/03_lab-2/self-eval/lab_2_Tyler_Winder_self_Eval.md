**Sprint Topic:**		curiosity Nano Explorer board basics  
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
Everything went well the code given worked well and understanding how the code works was an fun activity,and the libraries needed for this section where very easy to install.
**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
the process with which the code uses to get the three different components working in parrall was something new that I was not familiar with. But it uses a loop to call the function of each component and each function has times to control when the processes happen.
**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
I did not have any issues with the arduino system. It was straight forward and was very helpful.
**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
No issues, so nothing to fix.
**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**
There are a lot of things to cover for the explorer board and how to use it without breaking it.
