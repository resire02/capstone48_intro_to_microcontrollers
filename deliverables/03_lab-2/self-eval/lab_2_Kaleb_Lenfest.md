**Sprint Topic:**		Curiosity Nano Explorer board introduction
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
The installation of the libraries for interfacing with the board were easy to locate and install, attatching the Curiosity Nano to the explorer was easy
**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**  
Splicing some of the code together was a little difficult to understand as it was doing multiple things at once, but communicating to the actual pieces seemed fairly simple thanks to the Adafruit libraries. Some of the finer details of where to position the Curiosity Nano on the bigger board were confusing at first but were explained by Tyler.
**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**  
None, the Arduino system in particular was easy to work with and required no extra setup aside from installing the adafruit packages. 
**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**  
N/A
**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**
- Where to place the Curiosity Nano on the board (pin wise) and its meaning
- Which libraries in specific to include
- Breaking down each section of the example we are basing on, into 3 chunks
- Finer details about how its functioning, not strictly getting it to function
