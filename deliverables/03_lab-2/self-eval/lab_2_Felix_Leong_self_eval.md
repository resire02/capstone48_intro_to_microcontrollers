Yes, I was able to remember to set the debugger option under tools after 

**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**  
Installing any Adafruit module prompts for automatic dependency installation. Need to add personal reminder to add changing tools â†’ programmer to curiosity nano onboard programmer.
