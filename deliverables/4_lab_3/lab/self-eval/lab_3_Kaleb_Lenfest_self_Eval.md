**Capstone Member:**	Kaleb Lenfest
**Sprint Name:**		Lab 3  
**Link to Taiga Task:**	[https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/98](https://tree.taiga.io/project/bookstrong-introduction-to-microcontroller/task/98)  
**Sprint Topic:**		PWM, ADC, and SPI
---

**What went well during the learning process?**  
Most of the topics were fairly easy to understand, and easy to test on the board.  
**Were there any topic(s) that were difficult to understand during the learning process?**   
SPI was a little difficult to grasp at first, specifically the timing aspect and having to send dummy values for communication. ADC/DAC was simple, and PWM was very easy to understand, might need a bit 
to explain why it works  
**What troubles/issues did you encounter while working with the Arduino system?**   
Figuring out how to actually use SPI for with the Curiosity Nano Explorer was a little difficult, given the limited amount of components that use it.  
**If you encountered any issues while working with Arduino, were you able to fix them? If so, what steps did you take to fix the issues you encountered?**    
No issues with Arduino itself  
**Anything important to note for development of the lab manual? This includes research, unusual problems, and external knowledge.**  
- Explain WHY PWM works the way it does, and how it alleviates problems with boards/its widespread use
- Be thorough on the SPI description
- Be thorough on speaker section
