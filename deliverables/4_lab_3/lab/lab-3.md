## UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

UART is a communication protocol that enables serial data exchange between two devices without requiring a clock signal. It allows data to be sent and received asynchronously, meaning that data bits are transmitted sequentially over a single wire. This protocol is commonly used for serial communication with microcontrollers and computers.

In the Curiosity Nano, UART allows the board to connect with a computer through a serial communication interface. The Curiosity Nano has a built-in USB-to-UART converter that translates UART signals into USB signals. When the board is connected to a computer via USB, the computer sees it as a virtual COM port, enabling data transfer through serial communication tools like a terminal emulator. This setup allows you to send data to and receive data from the Curiosity Nano for debugging or data exchange.
