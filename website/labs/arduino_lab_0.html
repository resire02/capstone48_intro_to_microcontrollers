            <h2>Required Materials</h2>
            <p>
                This lab requires the following materials:
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop or Laptop Computer (Windows is highly recommended).</li>
                <li>Web Browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).</li>
                <li>Access to the Internet.</li>
            </ul>




            This lab was designed to work with Windows operating systems. For other operating systems, steps may
            differ from what is listed in this lab manual.

            <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
            <p>
                This Guide is designed to equip you with the fundamental skills that you will need while working with
                Arduino and Curiosity Nano. By completing this Quick Start Guide you will be able to:

            <ol>
                <li>Set up the Arduino development environment. This will include how to download and install the
                    Arduino
                    IDE software.</li>
                <li>Be able to navigate through the Arduino environment. This will include installing the needed board
                    support package for AVR boards.</li>
                <li>Understand Arduino code structure. This will include the core concepts of Arduino programming such
                    as
                    setup(), loop(), pinMode(), digitalWrite() and delay().</li>
            </ol>

            This guide will provide you with a foundation for learning electrical circuits and prepare you for the
            rest of the labs that you will take.

            <h2>Installation Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the Arduino Software page (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).</li>
                <li>Download and run the MSI Installer (Windows).</li>
                <li>The IDE should be immediately installed. Run it and allow it some time to install dependencies.</li>

                <img src="../../deliverables/1_getting-started/lab/images/download.png">

                <li>Go to File \-\> Preferences and under the Settings tab, check **'compile'** and **'upload'** to
                    enable verbose output. </li>
                <li>Under the same tab, click on the icon next to 'Additional Board Manager URLs' </li>
                <li>Copy and paste the following URL into the text box and click OK.
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://drazzy.com/package\_drazzy.com\_index.json">http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
                            </a>
                            (Enables access to external microcontroller libraries not included in the default setup)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <img src="../../deliverables/1_getting-started/lab/images/preferences.png">

                <li>Go to the Board Manager by clicking on the second icon from top to bottom on the left panel. </li>
                <li>Type 'DxCore' and click INSTALL. This installs the primary support package. (Arduino had general
                    libraries to support sensors, but as vendors started making boards, board-specific libraries became
                    an independent category of libraries known as core libraries)</li>

            <h2>Tour of the Source Files</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Open File Explorer. Go to C:\\Users\\{YourUsername}</li>
                <li>Show hidden files (See Appendix) and go to
                    AppData\\Local\\Arduino15\\packages\\DxCore\\hardware\\megaavr\\1.5.11</li>
                <li>This directory is the collection of C, C++, assembly, and header files that support the AVR Dx
                    microcontroller panel.</li>
                <li>Go to cores\\dxcore.</li>
                <li>Open wiring.c with the IDE of your preference.</li>
                <li>In ***wiring.c*** you will find an implementation of the Wiring API specifically designed for the
                    AVR
                    Dx microcontrollers.</li>
                <li>Check out the millis() function\!</li>
