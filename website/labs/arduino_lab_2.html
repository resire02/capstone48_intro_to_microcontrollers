            <p>
                Setting up your Curiosity Nano Explorer Board is a straightforward process.

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><i>Installing the Curiosity Nano</i>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Align the Boards: Place your Curiosity Nano board at the top of the Explorer Board, ensuring the
                        USB connector faces the top edge.</li>
                    <li>Align the Pins: Align the pins of the Curiosity Nano with the topmost female header pins on the
                        Explorer Board.</li>
                    <li>Secure the Connection: Gently push the Curiosity Nano onto the header pins to establish a secure
                        connection.</li>

                </ul>
                <li><i>Understanding the Pin Connections</i>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peripheral Connections: The Explorer Board connects the Curiosity Nano's pins to various
                        peripherals. Refer to the markings on either side of the female header pins to identify these
                        connections.</li>
                    <li>Pin Jumpers: The pin jumpers link peripherals to the Curiosity Nano.</li>
                    <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/boardpinconnections.png">
                </ul>
                <li><i>Remapping Pins</i>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>If you need to use a peripheral that doesn't have a direct connection to your Curiosity Nano,
                            you can remap pins.</i>:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disconnect the Jumper: Remove the pin jumper from the peripheral you want to remap.</li>
                        <li>Connect the Wire: Use a jumper wire to connect the desired pin on the Curiosity Nano to the
                            corresponding pin on the peripheral.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="section-header-title">Serial Communication - I2C</h2>
            <p>
                The Explorer features an I2C bus with several attached devices and external connectivity options. All
                connected devices are compatible with Standard Mode
                (100 kHz) and Fast Mode (400 kHz) I2C. The bus is designed to meet the rise-time requirements for both
                modes. The SDA and SCL signals are connected to the COM section of the CNANO socket.

                Two components in this lab can be controlled via the I2C Bus.
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>The Amber LED Row can be controlled from the I/O Expander 1 via the I2C Bus.</li>
                <li>The OLED Display is directly connected to the I2C Bus.</li>
            </ul>
