                The Explorer features an I2C bus with several attached devices and external connectivity options. All
                connected devices are compatible with Standard Mode
                (100 kHz) and Fast Mode (400 kHz) I2C. The bus is designed to meet the rise-time requirements for both
                modes. The SDA and SCL signals are connected to the COM section of the CNANO socket.

                Two components in this lab can be controlled via the I2C Bus.

            <h2 class="section-header-title">Installing Needed Libraries</h2>
            <p>

                The Arduino IDE utilizes libraries that simplify working with specific chips and components. For this
                lab, we'll use
                libraries provided by Adafruit. Follow these steps to install them:

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Open the Arduino IDE. On the left-hand side, click the icon that resembles a set of books (library
                    manager icon), as shown in the image below.</li>
                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/install1.png">
                <li>In the search bar, type "Adafruit GFX". Locate the library named "Adafruit GFX Library" and click
                    Install (see image below).</li>
                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/install2.png">
                <li>Click Install All when prompted.</li>
                <li>Next, search for "Adafruit SSD1306" and install the library labeled "Adafruit SSD1306", as shown in
                    the image.</li>
                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/install3.png">
                <li>Again, click Install All when prompted.</li>
                <li>Finally, search for "Adafruit MCP23008" and install the "Adafruit MCP23008 Library" as shown.</li>
                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/install4.png">
                <li>Click Install All to complete the installation process. These libraries will support the components
                    we'll use in the lab, enabling smoother control over displays, sensors, and other connected devices.
                </li>

            <h2 class="section-header-title">Working With the Amber LEDs</h2>
            <p>
                The MCP23008, or the "Amber LEDs", are a set of 8 LEDs located near the Microchip logo at the bottom of
                the Curiosity Explorer Board. These 8 LEDs will be used for learning our basics of communicating to the
                on-board components.

                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/AmberLED_Location.png">

                The MCP23008 is connected to the Curiosity Nano in a few different ways. The primary connections are the
                I2C-SDA and I2C-SCL, which are used to communicate over the I2C bus connected to the IO-Expander 1.
                Note, the I2C address for the IO-Expander, which we will use in code later, is located at the top of the
                location where the LEDs are on the board (in this case being 0x25).

                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/MCP23008_Wiring.png">

                To test this component, we will be creating a small sketch that "bounces" a light from one side of the
                LEDs to the other. Our goal will be to have the left-most LED start as on, then turn off, an the one
                right of it to turn on, repeating this until it reaches the other side, and then turning around and
                doing the opposite (right turns on, then off, one left of it turn and so on).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="section-header-title">Working with the Amber LEDs - Sample Script</h2>
            <p>
                To start our sketch, we will import a few basic libraries that will allow us to easily communicate to
                the IO-Expander 1. This sketch can be found under Lab 2/AmberDisplays.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;
#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;
#include "Adafruit_MCP23008.h"
                </code></pre>

            Here, we are getting the basic libraries for communication over I2C, and the specific Adafruit library for
            communicating to the MCP23008.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
Adafruit_MCP23008 mcp_leds;
                                    </code></pre>

            Next, outside of our setup or loop functions, we will create a variable to hold the reference to our LEDs.
            This holds the necessary methods we need to interact with the LEDs.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
void setup() {
    uint8_t pin_id, status;
    
    status = mcp_leds.begin(0x25);
    
    for (pin_id = 0; pin_id &lt; 8; pin_id++) {
        mcp_leds.pinMode(pin_id, OUTPUT);
        mcp_leds.digitalWrite(pin_id, HIGH);
    }
}
                                </code></pre>

            Inside of our setup function, we define a variable for pin_id, which we use to iterate through our available
            pins, and a status variable to store the result of starting our mcp_leds. Note, we are using the address
            (0x25) that we noted earlier to instantiate the connection. While we aren't doing anything with this
            variable in this code, it can be used to debug later if necessary.

            Now, instead of putting all of our code into our loop function, since it might be a bit long, we will create
            a separate method for it

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
void loop() {
    cylon();
}
    
void cylon(void) {
    static uint8_t led_index = 0, led_state = false, led_dir = true;
    static unsigned long cylon_timer = 0UL;
    unsigned long now;
    
    now = millis();
    if (now - cylon_timer > 37UL) {
        cylon_timer = now;
        if (led_state) {
            led_state = false;
            mcp_leds.digitalWrite(led_index, HIGH);
        } else {
            led_state = true;
            mcp_leds.digitalWrite(led_index, LOW);
        }
    
        if (led_state == false) {
            if (led_dir) {
                led_index++;
                if (led_index > 7) {
                led_index = 7;
                led_dir = false;
                }
            } else {
                led_index--;
                if (led_index > 127) {  // unsigned 8 bit gone negative
                    led_index = 0;
                    led_dir = true;
                }
            }
        }   
    }
}
                                                    </code></pre>

            This is quite a large method! But the functionality of it is actually quite simple. Initially, we start by
            instantiating our necessary variables, those being:

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><i>led_index</i> - An unsigned integer representing which LED we are currently looking at</li>
                <li><i>led_state</i> - An unsigned integer (though used as a boolean) representing if the LED is on or
                    off</li>
                <li><i>led_dir</i> - An unsigned integer representing the direction that the lights are travelling (left
                    to right or right to left), also treated as a boolean</li>
                <li><i>cylon_timer</i> - An unsigned long representing the time since we last updated the LEDs</li>
            </ul>

            Note that all of these variables are marked with the static keyword, which will ensure that their values are
            kept between calls to our "loop" method.

            And finally,

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><i>now</i> - An unsigned long representing the current time</li>
            </ul>

            Now we have all the necessary values we need to determine how to manipulate the LEDs to match our pattern of
            bouncing back and forth.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
if (led_state) {
    led_state = false;
    mcp_leds.digitalWrite(led_index, HIGH);
} else {
    led_state = true;
    mcp_leds.digitalWrite(led_index, LOW);
}
                                                    </code></pre>

            Our first if statement is what turns on or off our LED at this location, if it is on, it is turned off, and
            if it is off it is turned on. This is done through the "digitalWrite" method on the mcp_leds instance we
            made earlier, and the led_index we created at the start of this method. Note again that the Curiosity Nano
            Explorer is low-activated, meaning that mcp_leds.digitalWrite(led_index, LOW); turns the LED on.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
if (led_state == false) {
    if (led_dir) {
        led_index++;
        if (led_index > 7) {
            led_index = 7;
            led_dir = false;
        }
    } else {
        led_index--;
        if (led_index > 127)  // unsigned 8 bit gone negative
        {
            led_index = 0;
            led_dir = true;
        }
    }
}
                                                                    </code></pre>

            In this if statement (note this is AFTER we have changed the led_state in the first if statement) we
            increment (or decrement) the current led_index based on the led_dir. Additionally, we check if we have
            reached the end of the LEDs (led_index > 7 for example), and change direction as necessary.

            And that's it! We now have a working program for bouncing an LED from one side to the other of the Amber
            LEDs, and an understanding of using the Adafruit library for the MCP23008.

                On the next page, you will find a script designed to animate a ring chase on the LEDs. This animation
                will create a dynamic effect where each LED lights up in sequence, transitioning through a range of
                colors. The core of the animation is managed by the loop function, which iterates over the following
                tasks every 211 milliseconds:

            <ol>
                <li>The function shifts the active LED, ensuring that each LED in the ring is illuminated in turn.</li>
                <li>Along with the shifting LED, the color of the active LED changes as well after being selected from a
                    predefined array named color_grid.</li>
                <li>Repeats from 1.</li>
            </ol>

            Transfer this snippet of code into a new sketch. The directive #include &lt;tinyNeoPixel.h&gt; adds support
            for controlling WS2812 LEDs. This sketch is available under Lab2/WS2812B_RingCycle in the source code.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">

void setup() {
    pixel_ring.begin();
}

        pixel_ring.clear();
        pixel_ring.show();    
        pixel_ring.setPixelColor(pixel_index,color_grid[color_index]);
        pixel_ring.show();
        pixel_index++;
        if(pixel_index > 7)
                pixel_index = 0;
        color_index++;
        if(color_index >= 3)
            color_index = 0;
    }
}

            <h2 class="section-header-title">Working With the Oled Display</h2>
            <p>
                The SSD1306 is an OLED display located towards the bottom right of the Curiosity Explorer Board. The
                display functions as a digital screen, with the capability to draw pixels in a 128-pixels wide by
                64-pixels high grid. The display does not support color, meaning pixels can only be ON or OFF.

                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/ssd1306_component.png">

                The SSD1306 is connected to the I2C-SDA and I2C-SCL hookups. The SDA is used for data transfer while the
                SCL is used to synchronize communication. These pins are already adjacent to the PA2 and PA3 pins on the
                Curiosity Nano, so there is no remapping required.

                <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/ssd1306_mapping.png">

                Working with the SSD1306 requires the Adafruit GFX and SSD1306 libraries, along with their dependency
                libraries:

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
                                    </code></pre>


            To interact with the display, we need to create an instance of the Adafruit_SSD1306 library with a few
            values:

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128      // OLED display width, in pixels
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64      // OLED display height, in pixels
#define OLED_RESET -1         // Reset pin, set to -1 to share Arduino reset pin
#define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3D   // 7-bit I2C Address
Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);
                                                    </code></pre>


            We now have a global variable named display. Then, in the setup() function, we need to add the following
            code to ready up the display:

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
void setup() {
    delay(1000); // Wait for the display to ready

    if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, SCREEN_ADDRESS)) {
        for(;;); // Display not connected or malfunctioning, loop forever
    }

    // ...
}
                                                                    </code></pre>

            This allows us to use the library's functions to draw pixels on the screen. The origin point (x=0, y=0) is
            located at the top left of the screen, as pixels are drawn left to right, up to down. Since the SSD1306 does
            not support color, all color values will always be 1 (white) or 0 (black). The library includes functions
            for drawing (Drawing methods can be found in the Adafruit_GFX.h file in the repository:
            https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/, Basic methods can be found in the Adafruit_SSD1306.h file
            in the repository: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306/), most notably:

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><b>clearDisplay()</b> - Clears the screen of all active pixels.</li>
                <li><b>drawPixel()</b> - Draws a single pixel at the given position</li>
                <li><b>drawLine()</b> - Draws a line between two given positions on the screen.</li>
                <li><b>drawRect()</b> - Draws a rectangle of a given width and height from a given screen position. Use
                    fillRect() to draw a filled in rectangle.</li>
                <li><b>drawCircle()</b> - Draws a circle of a given radius from a given screen position. Use
                    fillCircle() to draw a filled in circle.</li>
                <li><b>drawTriangle()</b> - Draws a triangle from 3 given positions. Use fillTriangle() to draw a filled
                    in triangle.</li>
                <li><b>drawChar()</b> - Prints a character at a given position of a given size.</li>
                <li><b>drawBitmap()</b> - Draws a 2D image using a given character array with a given width and height
                    at a given position.</li>
            </ul>

            The OLED display will display the Adafruit logo by default, we need to call clearDisplay() to clear it off
            before doing any draw operations:

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
display.clearDisplay(); // clear the Adafruit logo
                                                                                    </code></pre>

            When drawing on the SSD1306, calling draw functions will not automatically show up on the display. To fix
            this, we need to follow up the draw function with display(). (Calling display() multiple times will not
            visibly do anything, unless additional draw operations are used)

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
display.fillRect(0, 0, 40, 20, 1);  // Draws a 40px by 20px rectangle at (0,0)
display.drawPixel(80, 40, 1);       // Draws a pixel at (80, 40)
display.drawCircle(80, 40, 20, 1);  // Draws a circle with 20px radius at (80, 40)
display.drawChar(20, 40, 'A', 1, 0, 2); // Draws 'A' of size 2 at (20,40)

display.display(); // Display draw operations on screen
                                                                                                    </code></pre>

            This generates the following visual on the OLED display. This sketch can be found under
            Lab2/OLED_DrawExample in the class code. In the next section, you will learn how to display an image on the
            OLED display using drawBitmap().

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="section-header-title">Displaying an Image Lab</h2>
            <p>
                1. Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch with the following code:


            <pre><code class="'language-c">
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>

#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64
#define OLED_RESET -1
#define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3D

Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

void setup() {
    delay(1000);
    if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, SCREEN_ADDRESS)) {
        for(;;);
    }
}

void loop() {

}
                                </code></pre>
            <p>
                2. Install the Adafruit SSD1306 library from the library manager tab. Ensure that the Adafruit GFX
                library
                and its dependencies are installed as well.
                3. Arduino cannot read the formatting nor handle the size of regular images, so the image will need to
                be
                converted to a bitmap image (.BMP) and shrunk to a small enough size to fit on the screen. Go to your
                start
                menu by pressing the Windows key and Open Microsoft Paint.
                4. On the top left corner, go to File -> Open, this should open up a File Explorer window. Select an
                image
                of your choosing then click "Open".
                5. Towards the top of the screen, in the "Image" menu section click on the "Resize and Skew" option. On
                older versions of Microsoft Paint, it may be called "Resize". Alternatively, the shortcut Ctrl+W can be
                used
                to access this menu.
            </p>

            <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/ssd1306_paint_resizing.png"
                style="transform: scale(0.4); transform-origin: top left;">>

            6. Change the "Resize" option to Pixels. Then modify either width or height such that the width is equal or
            less than 128 pixels and the height is equal or less than 64 pixels. This is because the SSD1306 is limited
            to 128 pixels by 64 pixels. It is recommended to select "Maintain Aspect Ratio" so that the image does not
            look distorted.

            <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/ssd1306_paint_resize_howto.png"
                style="max-height: 800px; width: 300px;">

            7. Once done, select "OK" to render the size changes.
            8. Then, on the top left, go to File -> Save As -> BMP picture, this should open up a File Explorer window.
            Select an appropriate directory to save to and select Save.

            <img src="../../deliverables/3_lab-2/lab/images/ssd1306_paint_saveas.png"
                style="max-height: 800px; width: 400px;">

            <p>
                9. Go to <a href="https://javl.github.io/image2cpp">https://javl.github.io/image2cpp</a>. Under "Select
                Image", upload the BMP image that was exported in
                the previous step. Canvas Size under Image Settings should be the same dimensions as the image.
                10. Scroll to the bottom and change Code Output Format to "Arduino code, single bitmap". Then, click on
                Generate Code. This should generate a code snippet (PROGMEM tells the micro-controller to store the
                variable
                in flash memory instead of in program memory. This is usually applied to variables that do not change at
                all
                during a program's execution and take up a notable amount of memory). Copy and paste this code snippet
                into
                the sketch before the setup() function.
                11. Directly after the image array, define width and height constants to store the dimensions of the
                image.
                This will be used to tell the library how tall and wide our image is.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
#define IMAGE_WIDTH <your image width in pixels>
#define IMAGE_HEIGHT <your image height in pixels>
                                                    </code></pre>

            12. In the setup() function, call drawBitmap() after the display has been initialized. We will draw the
            image from the top left corner so that no part of the image is cut off.

            <pre><code class="'language-c">
void setup() {
    drawBitmap(0, 0, <name of image array>, IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 1)
}
                                                                    </code></pre>

            13. Select the port and board then compile the sketch, ensuring that Tools -> Chip is set to "AVR64DD32 and
            Tools -> Programmer is set to "Curiosity Nano". Use Sketch -> Upload Using Programmer to send the code to
            your Curiosity Explorer.
            14. You should now see an image show up on the SSD1306 display. If the image does not show up, check that
            your Curiosity Nano is properly connected to the Curiosity Explorer board. See Lab2/OLED_ImageLab for an
            example of the lab.

            The SSD1306 OLED display is a very versatile peripheral that can be used to display graphics. For a more
            advanced example, check out the bouncing logo sketch under Lab2/OLED_BouncingLogo in the class code.
