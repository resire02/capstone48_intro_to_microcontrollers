                <p>
                    This lab requires the following materials:
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>A desktop or laptop computer</li>
                    <li>Arduino IDE (Go to <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">https://www.arduino.cc/en/software</a>
                        if not installed already)</li>
                    <li>DXCore support library</li>

                    This lab was designed to work with Windows operating systems. For other operating systems, steps

                <h2 class="section-header-title">Learning Objectives</h2>
                <p>
                    This lab is intended to give you an understanding of how to deploy a basic program to your Curiosity
                    Nano board. Along the way, you will learn:
                <ul>
                    <li>How to identify pins on the Curiosity Nano board (and their associated number in code)</li>
                    <li>A few basic methods common to almost all programs run on the board</li>
                    <li>How to blink an on-board LED.</li>
                </ul>
                Throughout this lab, you will gain a greater understanding of how to work with the board through Arduino
                IDE, deploy code to the Curiosity Nano board, and identify features on the board.

                <h2 class="section-header-title">The "Sketch" File</h2>
                <p>
                    A “sketch” file is a program that is uploaded onto an Arduino board by Arduino IDE. Sketch files
                    contain functions, which are grouped lines of code that can be called from anywhere in the program.
                    A function contains a header, which details the function name and what values it requires, and a
                    body, that details what code should be run when the function is called.
                <p>
                    <img src="../../deliverables/2_lab-1/lab/images/sketch-functions-visual-explanation.png">
                <p>
                    There are 5 functions that are available to all Arduino sketches:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>setup</b> – runs once during program execution.</li>
                    <li><b>loop</b> – runs infinitely during program execution.</li>
                    <li><b>pinMode</b> – labels a specific pin as a source to read from (input) or as a source to write to (output).</li>
                    <li><b>digitalWrite</b> – sets a pin’s voltage to either LOW (0V) or HIGH (5V or 3.3V).</li>
                    <li><b>delay</b> – tells the sketch to wait a specified number of milliseconds before running the next line.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The <b>setup</b> and <b>loop</b> functions need to be defined with a function body, while the
                    <b>pinMode</b>, <b>digitalWrite</b>, and <b>delay</b> functions can be called without defining
                    a function body. This is because setup and loop are special functions that are called by the
                    Arduino program and contain the main functionality of the sketch.

                <h2 class="section-header-title">Pin Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    The Curiosity Nano board we are using for this lab has 28 pins that can be controlled by the
                    Arduino. Each pin serves different functions. In Lab 1, we will focus on GPIO pins. GPIO stands for
                    <b>General-Purpose Input/Output</b>. These pins can either send or read binary values (1's and 0's),
                    which allows them to control devices like LEDs, read button states, or communicate with external devices.
                <p>
                    Of the 28 pins, 25 can function as GPIO pins, with pin PF5 tied to an onboard LED, making it usable
                    only as an output pin. The GPIO pins are shown in gray in the pinout image below.
                <p>

                <p>
                    When using GPIO pins in Arduino, we need to define each pin before using it. Since Arduino can
                    program various boards, each pin is assigned a number. For our board, the pins are numbered 0 to 27.
                    The corresponding pin numbers can be seen below:
                <p>
                    #define PIN_PA0 (0)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA1 (1)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA2 (2)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA3 (3)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA4 (4)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA5 (5)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA6 (6)<br>
                    #define PIN_PA7 (7)<br>
                    #define PIN_PC0 (8)<br>
                    #define PIN_PC1 (9)<br>
                    #define PIN_PC2 (10)<br>
                    #define PIN_PC3 (11)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD0 (12) // NOT_A_PIN<br>
                    #define PIN_PD1 (13)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD2 (14)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD3 (15)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD4 (16)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD5 (17)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD6 (18)<br>
                    #define PIN_PD7 (19)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF0 (20)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF1 (21)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF2 (22)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF3 (23)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF4 (24)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF5 (25)<br>
                    #define PIN_PF6 (26) // RESET<br>
                    #define PIN_PF7 (27) // UPDI<br>
